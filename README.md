##Grocery list React and testing exercise

This is an exercise for Module 3 of Turing. It's not to be confused with my independently-created [Flash Shopper app](https://github.com/gness1804/grocery-list-react). The present app includes a basic means to create a grocery list, modify items, and delete them.
